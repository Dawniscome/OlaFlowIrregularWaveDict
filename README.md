# OlaFlowIrregularWaveDict
# WaveDict Generator for OlaFlow

This repository contains an m-file that generates an irregular waveDict file for use with the OlaFlow solver. The project aims to provide a free and open-source solution for generating waveDict files specifically designed for irregular waves in the OlaFlow framework. The formulation is based on the guidelines presented in DNV-RP-H103 (Modelling and Analysis of Marine Operations), along with insights from the comprehensive PDF file "Overview of ocean wave statistics" by Casas Prat, M. (2008). It is strongly suggested to review these files.

## Features

- Generate waveDict files tailored for irregular wave simulations in OlaFlow.
- Potentially, usable for a wide range of wave frequencies from ultra gravity waves to long-period waves
- Follows the guidelines and recommendations of DNV-RP-H103 for accurate wave modeling.
- Utilizes statistical information from "Overview of ocean wave statistics" to enhance wave representation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the m-file directly.
2. Open the m-file in MATLAB or Octave.
3. Run the script to generate the waveDict file.
4. Import the input parameters to match your desired wave characteristics and storm duration.
5. Use the generated waveDict file in your OlaFlow simulations.
